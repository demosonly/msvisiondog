# MsVisionDog

MsVisionDog is a quick-and-dirty application that was created during a HACK EVENT (focusing on Intelligent Services) at TED Sync Week in June 2015.

It is a sample (i.e. not at all production ready) application using <a href="https://www.projectoxford.ai/" target="_blank">Project Oxford</a> Computer Vision and Speech APIs that is deployed as Microsoft Azure Web App, using Azure Blob Storage for images and audio, and Azure SQL Database for user accounts and metadata.

Although not demonstrated in code, the application is also indented to use <a href="https://www.luis.ai" target="_blank">Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)</a> to understand natural language instructions such as "send email to Rob", "call Rob", "this is Rob".

The primary premise/idea of the mobile application is depicted in the following screenshots:
